              Hi, my name is Rutuja and I am a{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">&apos;highly ambitious&apos;</span>,
              <span className="font-bold">&apos;self-motivated&apos;</span>, and
              <span className="font-bold">&apos;driven&apos;</span> Full Stack Developer.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I am currently enrolled in a Master of Science in Information
              Systems program at Northeastern University, Boston.
              I am an enthusiastic Computer Engineer who enjoys problem solving in Software Engineering
              and User Experience. I have practiced programming in many different languages such as C, C++, JavaScript
              and Python. Apart from this I&apos;m more interested in Front end Development and UI/UX design.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I have completed my Undergraduation from Pune University with a (8.71/10 GPA) in Computer Science.
              I&apos;ve been constantly involved in developing scalable and relevant projects for my coursework and personal interests, 
              and I hope to use my skill set to reinvent techniques and specialize in software and front end development to deliver 
              high-quality products.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I believe that you should{" "}
              <span className="font-bold text-teal-500">
                never stop growing
              </span>{" "}
              and that&apos;s what I strive to do, I have a passion for
              technology and a desire to always push the limits of what is
              possible. I am excited to see where my career takes me and am
              always open to new opportunities. 🙂
